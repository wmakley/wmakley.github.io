I finally decided it was extremely necessary to make myself a personal site!

## The Goal

The first thing I did was identify the purpose of this site, which was easy:

1. Showcase my CV/Resume.
2. Make me look like a good developer to hire.
  * Simple and tasteful design.
  * Blog.

For my own convenience, I also wanted the following:

1. Deploy via `git push`.
2. No maintenance required.

## What I Went With

### 1. [NameCheap][namecheap]

NameCheap was an easy and obvious choice for domain registration. Its DNS control panel proved painless and included more than enough free "extras" for my needs, such as redirects and email forwarders.

### 2. [ProtonMail][protonmail]

I wanted secure email without Google spying. ProtonMail was currently the most talked-about and obvious choice. It was easy to make it my default provider in NameCheap.

### 3. [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]

I already use Github all the time, so this was a no-brainer. It gives me `git push` deploy convenience, allows me to use a custom domain, and requires absolutely no maintenance on my part. After setting up [Jekyll][jekyll] I have everything I need. Beautiful!

## Next Steps

* More and better copy.
* Personal photos.
* A little bit more flare to the design.
