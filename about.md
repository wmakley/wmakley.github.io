Self-motivated and experienced software engineer with a wide variety of experience in all aspects of software development, especially web applications. I love my family, making things, using my skills to help others, learning new technologies and professional practices, and Yoga.

## Specialties

• Understanding my clients' business goals at a deep level, so that I can meet them as quickly and directly as possible.

• Strong verbal and written communication skills.

• Many years of experience and a deep level of expertise with Ruby on Rails and similar web frameworks, especially Java EE, PHP, and Python/Django.

• Working with challenging legacy code, using test-driven techniques.

• Continually improving my skills, learning new technologies and best practices, and using the best tool for the job. (Recently I have enjoyed learning Elm, Go, and TypeScript.)

• Simple, maintainable, and performant code.

## Experience

The kinds of projects I have worked on include:

• An application to track all stages of luxury home construction (sales / pre-construction / construction / warranty), and generate detailed progress reports. Includes CRM, price book, contract creation/printing, notifications, tasking, design tools, logging, customer satisfaction, and detailed progress tracking.

• Large Ruby on Rails E-Commerce sites with payment gateway integration, complex pricing, attractive user experiences, and continuous data import and export.

• Document portal for company to upload documents for their customers. Includes detailed permissions, tagging, searching, multiple customers, and SFTP drop box.
